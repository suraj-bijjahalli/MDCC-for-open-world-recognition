# MDCC-for-open-world-recognition
This is an initial implementation of Multi-stage Deep Classifier Cascades (MDCC) for Open World Recognition task as described in our paper:

# Dataset
There are two datasets, one is for RF signal recognition and another is for twitter dataset. The dataset is generated by the coauthor and do please cite formally when you use these two dataset.

# Run the model
For each task, when run the model:
          `python MDCC.py`

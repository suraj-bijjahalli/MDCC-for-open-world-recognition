# MDCC-for-open-world-recognition
This is an initial implementation of Multi-stage Deep Classifier Cascades (MDCC) for Open World Recognition task as described in our paper:

# Dataset
There are two datasets, one is for [RF signal recognition](https://exchangelabsgmu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xguo7_masonlive_gmu_edu/EUMFyD5TWnFFo7sL0AXWOD0BV-VRQyW9IahE1Gh_OTvl5w?e=PBeoel) and another is for [twitter dataset](https://exchangelabsgmu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xguo7_masonlive_gmu_edu/EVb5O9TtPzxAnM1-LzkVSjwBfU8mdD5Yw-z0o9p3HWJq9w?e=Qo3gy5).

# Run the model
For each task, when run the model:
          `python MDCC.py`
          
The training procedure, testing procedure, and ealuating procedure are self-contained in the `MDCC.py` file.         

You are welcom to connect me regarding any confusions about the codes.

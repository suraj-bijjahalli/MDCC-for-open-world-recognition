# MDCC-for-open-world-recognition
This is an initial implementation of Multi-stage Deep Classifier Cascades (MDCC) for Open World Recognition task as described in our paper:

# Dataset
#### datasets from this paper
There are two datasets from this paper, one is for [RF signal recognition](https://exchangelabsgmu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xguo7_masonlive_gmu_edu/EUMFyD5TWnFFo7sL0AXWOD0BV-VRQyW9IahE1Gh_OTvl5w?e=PBeoel) and another is for [twitter dataset](https://exchangelabsgmu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xguo7_masonlive_gmu_edu/EVb5O9TtPzxAnM1-LzkVSjwBfU8mdD5Yw-z0o9p3HWJq9w?e=Qo3gy5). 

The datasets are generated by the coauthor and do please cite formally when you use these two dataset as:

#### Additional dataset in open world domain
[ILSVRC2010](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2010/#data). It contains about 1.2M images for training (with 650 âˆ¼ 3000 images per class), 50K images for validation and 150K images for testing.

[Places-2](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html). The second dataset is the recent Places-2 dataset, which contains over 10M images of 400 different scene types. The dataset features 5000 to 30,000 training images per class, consistent with real-world frequencies of occurrence. 


# Run the model
For RF task, when run the model:

            `python MDCC.py`
          
For twotter task, run the model as:
  
         `python retain_MDCC.py`

          
The training procedure, testing procedure, and ealuating procedure are self-contained in the `MDCC.py` file.
